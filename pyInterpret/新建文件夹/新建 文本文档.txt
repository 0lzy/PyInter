An effective TV commercial is "JINKELA"which is a fertilizer additive that is said to be produced in China. It became popular because of an advertising video of trio fighting for JINKELA. For example, the content of the dialogue: "Africa's agriculture is underdeveloped, and we should all support him".Because the advertising effect is too exaggerated and funny, the characters' lines rhyme with each other, it has become a classic ghost material.
